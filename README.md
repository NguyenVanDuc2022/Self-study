# Self-study
This repo is for self studying.
I will implement the python code via 100 examples in this repo.
Since you have the better idea for my code, please up it to my repo.

1. Write a program to find all numbers that are divisible by 7 but not multiples of 5, within the range 2000 and 3200
(including 2000 and 3200). The resulting numbers will be printed as a string on one line, separated by commas.
2. Write a program that can calculate the factorial of a given number. Results are printed as a string on one line,
separated by commas. For example, the given number is 8 then the output should be 40320.
3. Given a given integer n, write a program to generate a dictionary containing (i,i*i) as integers from 1 to n (including
1 and n) and then print this dictionary. Example: Assuming number n i 8, the output will be:
{1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25, 6:36, 7:49, 8:64}
4. Write a program that accepts a comma-separated string of numbers from the console, produces a list and a tuple
containing all the numbers.
Example: Input given is 34, 67, 55, 33, 12, 98 then output is:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
5. Define a class with at least 2 methods:
getString: to get a user inputted string from the console.
printString: print the string entered to upper case.
Add simple checker functions to test class methods
6. Write a method that calculates the square of a number.
7. Python has many built-in function, if you don't know how to use it, you can read the documentation online or find some
books. But Python also has function documentations available for every built-in function in Python. The requirement of
this task is to write a program to print documentation of some of the built-in Python functions such asn abs(), int(),
input() and add documentation for the function you define yourself.
8. Defines a class that has a class parameter and the same instance parameter.
9. Write a program and print the value according to the given formula: Q = sqrt([(2 * C * D)/H]) (in words: Q is equal to
the square root of [(2 times C times D) divided by H]. With a fixed value of C of 50, H of 30. D is a range of custom
values, entered from the user interface, the values of D are separated by commas.
For example:
Assuming the values string of D input is 100, 150 , 180, the output will be 18, 22, 24.
10. Write a program that takes 2 digits X,Y takes the values from the input and creates a 2 dimensional array. The element
value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array must be i*j.
Note: i = 0, 1, ..., X-1; j = 0, 1, ..., Y-1.
For example: Input X, Y value is 3,5, the output is: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

Thank you!
